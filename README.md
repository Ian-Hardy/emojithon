# Emojithon

This repo provides an interpreter for my own programming language, Emojithon. Mostly a learning exercise, but super fun once you get the hang of it! Hello world is as easy as 🦜🐣💬👋🌎💬🐓 

Please feel free to clone it and write your own Emoji Code! 🦜🦜🦜

To run emojithon, simply navigate to the root of the repository and run "python3 emojithon.py"

To run some of the examples, start up emojithon and simply input 🌚🐣💬examples/{example_file}💬🐓

For instance, to calculate some fibonacci numbers run emojithon and copy the following: 🌚🐣💬examples/fib.emoji💬🐓
