# Em😎jithon

This repo provides an interpreter for my own programming language, Emojithon. It's super fun once you get the hang of it! Hello world is as easy as 🦜🐣💬👋🌎💬🐓 

Please feel free to clone it and write your own Emoji Code! 🦜🦜🦜

To run emojithon, simply navigate to the root of the repository and run "python3 emojithon.py"

To run some of the examples, start up emojithon and simply input 🌚🐣💬examples/{example_file}💬🐓

For instance, to calculate some fibonacci numbers run emojithon and copy the following:

If you want to write your own emoji code, the emoji_dictionary provides some useful keymojis to know, as well as some syntax for control statements, data structures, function definitions and function calling.
